###### Describe the use case you have chosen

Our goal is to make project management easier by developing a tool that helps with material management, schedule coordination and cost estimation by using BIM data.  

###### Who is the use case for?

The use case is designed for the project manager and the craftsmen on the construction site. 

###### What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case

The non-Bim disciplinary area of expertise used in this project are listed below: 

- Computer Science, which includes basic programming knowledge 
  
- Project management, ensures that budgets and resources are optimized and aligned with the project management principles 
  
- Mathematics and statistics for cost estimation and schedule optimization 
  

###### What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)

The developed script focuses on the early stages of the use case, which is to extract information from the project’s objects and their associated properties and compile a list of details that includes Name, GlobalID, type, length, area and volume. This is supposed to make the classification of the construction elements easier.  

If the script is to be further developed, you can use IFC concepts to show which floors the various building elements are located on. In addition, you can make the script calculate various prices for the building elements and in the end find out the costs for the whole project. 

###### What disciplinary analysis does it require?

This project requires project planning, cost estimation and overall project management. Knowledge of construction methods is also essential when a building is to be erected. 

###### What building elements are you interested in?

The building elements in focus are the structural building components such as foundation, floor beams, columns.  

The developed script is limited to extracting data from beams and columns right now, but this can easily be modified to do the same for foundations, floor, and other elements as well.  

###### What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?

General architectural concept and material choices for the building need to be accomplished before material management, schedule coordination and cost estimation can be begun.  

###### What is the input data for your use case?

Building elements, material quantity, prices for different materials and time estimation.  

###### What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?

When our use case has be done, the use cases in construction phase can begin, these includes site preparation, foundation construction, structural framing and more.
