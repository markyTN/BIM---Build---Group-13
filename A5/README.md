At the beginning of this course, we saw ourselves as level 1 modeller, the noobies that had minimal knowledge of OpenBIM and FOSS. Throughout the course and the various assignments, we advanced ourselves into somewhere between level 2 and 3 analysts.  

##### What else do you still need to learn

If the goal is to become experts in OpenBIM, there are still many subjects that we can learn about, as there are more OpenBIM roles to be explored.  

When we started the course, none of us really knew how to use Python properly, and honestly, we're still struggling. Python was a big deal in the course, so we need to get the hang of it to work with OpenBIM better. 

##### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

If we continue to work with OpenBIM and enhance our proficiency, it could potentially optimize some processes and future task solutions.  

##### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

In the same way as there were some examples of focus areas, it would have been nice if there were the same with the use cases. It´s nice to have something to choose from but it can quickly become a bit overwhelming if you can choose from everything.  

##### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

The number of tools was fine, but GitHub might have been a bit unnecessary. We hadn´t used it before and we couldn´t see the advantages of using it over the regular Learn format.  

##### Feedback received on the tutorial:

Did the tool address the use case you identified?  

- The use case: To make project management easier by developing a tool that helps with material management, schedule coordination and cost estimation by using BIM data. 

- Using the tool the operator can gather the addressed data and use it for the building project in question. 

- Was the use case well modelled  

- The use case is clearly modelled in the script and explained well in the video. 

- The tool is level 3 OpenBim analyst appropriate as it can be used for further modification. 

- The model could be modified and might be more useful by having the possibility to address each floor and the total magnitude of each material on that particular floor. ( For example, on construction time it would be beneficial to get an overview on the total quantities for second floor, due to cost analysis or for material management. ) This is a feature that can be added at later times. 

Was the project clearly scoped  

- The project scope is clear given the timeframe that was given in the course. The group had clear goal of what they wanted to achieve with the tool and are well on their way with this tool. 

##### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in the future

We don’t know if we will be working with OpenBIM directly, but we can see the potential and usefulness of OpenBIM tools, and there's a good chance we'll be using them in the future. We might end up working with these tools without even realizing it. 

##### Conclude the journey through A1-A5

Now that the course doesn´t have any specific requirements regarding proficiency in Python and Blender, it would have been nice if the initial assignments were simply about to getting to know the tools better. The self-learning part got a bit intense, especially when you're not really familiar with coding and blenderBIM. 

We like the concepts of the 5 assignments, where each assignment is not a completely new task, but focusing on improving the existing products.
